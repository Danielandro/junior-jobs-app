> Junior Developer Job Aggregator App

## Aim

Build an application that grabs junior developer jobs from open source APIs and puts them all in one place. The first API used is Github jobs as it's has open and easy to use.

The main aim was to explore a few new concepts (in-memory data structure, cron workers).

## Tech Stack

- React (Front-End)
- Node.js (Back-End)
- Express (API)
- Redis (Cache)
- Cron Worker

## Prerequisites

- Redis

1. Visit the [Redis homepage](https://redis.io/) and install the latest version
2. Start redis-server in console using the command `redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf`

## Install

Clone the project

`npm install` to install the dependencies

## Usage

To use the app, there are **three steps**:

**1.** Fetch the jobs & store in redis:

- From the project folder, type in the command line `node ./worker/index`

- This will fetch jobs from the Github jobs API every minute. To terminate press `ctrl + c`

**2.** Start the server

- Open another terminal and enter `node ./api/index`.

- This will start the server on port 3001. To terminate press `ctrl + c`

**3.** Start the application

- Open another instance of the terminal and enter `cd client`

- Enter `npm install` to install the dependencies.

- Enter `npm run start` to start the app on port 3000

- Go to your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Approach

![Diagram of application structure](/screenshots/app-diagram.png)

1. I started by creating a diagram (as above) of how the different elements needed to interact with eachother and how the data would flow.

2. I bootstrapped the client using create-react-app, structuring it as a single page application. Only one route is required and any future features such as filtering by certain attributes can be achieved by updating the state and re-rendering the page. I defined some mock job data based on the JSON returned by the Github jobs API, and set this as the initial state with the top level `App` component.

3. Passing this data down, utilising the one-way data flow of React, I defined the child components (Jobs & Job) to render each result. I also utilised some components of the Material-UI library to define some basic styling using CSS-in-JS. I could have gone with plain CSS or a pre-processor like SASS, but I wanted to experiment.

4. Next, I created the cron worker and the module that calls the Github jobs API. I used a modular and functional structure as I feel it opens the opportunity to for extending the project using other APIs and makes it easily readable. Once thing I could change, would be to separate out the saving of the data to redis into a separate module. This would provide better adherance to single responsibility for each module, and encourage reusability.

5. I then defined a simple API using express, with a single endpoint `/jobs` that returned the job data from the database. In order to allow the endpoint to be accessed by the client from a different domain, had to define a `access-control-allow-origin` header on the server response.

6. The final step was to call the API from the client and set the state on the App component. I used the `useState` & `useEffect` hooks to call the API and set the state when App mounts (i.e. on page load). I chose to utilise ES6 and React hooks, as the are both modern implementations that are currently well supported.

## Issues

- Some listings are returned multiple times. Need to be filtered out
- Front-end needs some love
